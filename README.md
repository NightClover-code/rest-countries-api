# REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./public/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The Challenge⚡️

The challenge was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the design. The idea for this project was brought by [@frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

I quite over-engineered this one, it was an opportunity for me to try to mix technologies that I was interested in, such as `React.js`, `Redux` & `Typescript`.

This will serve as a good boilerplate for your future `Redux` and `Typescript` projects.

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
- See the color mode and the country saved in local storage automatically
